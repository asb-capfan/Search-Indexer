  - Internal structure change : use Btree instead of Hash for

    through words in the dictionary, or through words in a 
    given doc. INDEXES ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PREVIOUS
    VERSION, you need to reindex your docs.

  - add" method : check that $docId is a fresh number
  - "remove" method : no longer necessary to supply text buffer;
    just give the docId to remove
  - new method "words" and "wordIds"
